# Kickstarting - Analysis
Analysis using Excel and it's functionalities
## Data sheet category 
Entertainment industry
- This Excel data sheet consist of various categoeries in the entertainment industry. 
- It displays plethora of data that will further help us generate desired information.
### Purpose
- The purpose of this project is create tables, graphs that will help understand the vast data as well as compare it with different categories.  
- We will make use of excel functionalities to generate results based on Launch date and Cost of Goals.

## Analysis
For analyzation we used: 
- Create a pivot table that does monthly analysis for Theatre category - of its Successful,failed and canceled shows.
- Create Line gragh that shows theatre monthly analysis for one year
- Create another Analysis which calculates Number of Successful,Failed and Canceled for "Plays" using alloted metrics for Goals amount.
- Create another line graph that displays the comparison between Successful, Failed, Cancaled  vividly

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch date for Theatre:
- There were more successful theatre than canceled. 
- Successful shows elevation during summer months of May, June, July.
- Highest canceled events were in the month so Jan and then it stablized for the rest of the year
- Failed shows are more or less been consistent ranging between 33 and highest being 50
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- There has been no canceled Plays. 
- The Highest succes rate was shown for the goal range - $1000-4999. But it also displayed highest failed plays. Yet placing this range as the second highest for Success rate which is 72%
- The hightest success rate was for range below $1000 which is 75%.
- For range $45000-49999, there were no successes and only one failed. Hence placing this at 100% failed percentage. 
- We also noticed major decrease of successful/failed plays as the Goal range value increased. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- To make the pivot as presented in the picture of the module. After shifting a few times the titles in columns and values I was able to produce the results
- I had to re-learn how to make changes in the date to to display it in the correct form
- The link I used is:

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. Successful rate is almost twice as compared to failed.
    2. Theatre is more succesful during summer months of May June and July.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    1. If Goal rate is set below $1000 - then the succes rate is higher.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    1. This Data set is country wise, so results are generalized for all the people in the country.
    2. The titles in the name column has no repetition, so we don't know if it repeated again - will it bring the same data results or not.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    1. We can create bar graph for Launchdate - It shows the bar comparison between successful,failed and canaceled threatre shows distritubed by month.
